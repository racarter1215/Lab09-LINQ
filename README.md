# LINQ App
##### Lab09-LINQ
##### Author: Robert Carter
##### Collaborated with: Nicholas Ryan, Bade Habib, Paul Rest

### Description

##### This is a C# console application that will utilize collections and enumerations to create a virtual library that a user can interact with in a variety of ways.
##### I first created both Book and Author classes which I used for the basis of building later in the code. I also built out the Program class to hold user interface instructions as well as places for the user to trigger methods that facilitate the desired result of their entered commands
##### I utilized enumerations and collections to manipulate and transfer data when and where required throughout the app.
